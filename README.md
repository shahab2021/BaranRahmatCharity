# BaranRahmatCharity

Project description:

At the beginning of its activity, the Baran Rahmat charity used to store its information in several Excel files that did not have the proper consistency. with the expansion of their activities, they wanted a coherent and web-based system. Their data included money collection boxes, recipients of the boxes, owners of the boxes, the information of the needy people, payments made, etc. Tables were designed in the MySQL database to store this data. To interact with these tables, the Django admin panel was used.
